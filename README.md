Github account: My github account holds 1 repository and 1 clone of that repository. 
Repository: First I clicked the plus button and then created a new repository. Then this repository was cloned and the README file was edited. 
Cloning Steps: In the Github desktop, in the File tab, I clicked "Clone Repositories" and then saved it to a file in my OneDrive.
